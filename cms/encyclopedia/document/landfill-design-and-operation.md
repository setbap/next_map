<p lang="en" style="direction: ltr;">
Municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) receive household waste. MSWLFs can also receive non-hazardous sludge, industrial solid waste, and construction and demolition debris. Modern landfills are well-engineered facilities that are located, designed, operated, and monitored to ensure compliance with federal regulations. Solid waste landfills must be designed to protect the environment from contaminants which may be present in the solid waste stream. The landfill siting plan prevents the siting of landfills in environmentally-sensitive areas while on-site environmental monitoring systems monitor for any sign of groundwater contamination and for landfill gas, and provides additional safeguards. In addition, many new landfills collect potentially harmful landfill gas emissions and convert the gas into energy.
